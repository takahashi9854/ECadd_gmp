How to calcurate P+Q?

1.Draw the line through P and Q and find the third intersection point P*Q.
2.Then I draw the line through P*Q and O, which is just the vertical line through P*Q.
3.A cubic Curve in Weierstrass form is symmetric about the x axis, so fo find P+Q, we just take P*Q and reflect it about the x axis.

How to define -Q?
1.The negative point of Q is the reflected point; if Q=(x,y), then -Q=(x,-y)
